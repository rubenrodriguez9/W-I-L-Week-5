# What I Learned Week-5

## If Statments
To filter through data and return what's needed we covered If Statments. We learned how to store data in container and use if statements to pluck out what was true according to our input
## Backend Logic
We learned how to call upon our functions from the backend part of Javascript. Keeping our logic in a libray (your back end file) is an organized way to make your apps.

## Front-end Logic
In our front end logic we learned how to call upon your backend and tie all the inputs together. Creating a funciton that will be able to let your user interact with your app. 

## Switches
We learned of an alternative to functions. They are ver similar to use however functions are a tad bit harder and but a lot more exact. 

## User Input
Having a user interact with your app is one of the main features when using Javascript. We dove into that with FizzBuzz.
